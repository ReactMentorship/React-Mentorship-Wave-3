ACT 6:
Convert the User object you had into an array, pass this object into the UserList Component as props (in case you don't have that component create it).

ACT 7:
Using the props sended from the parent component into the UserList component iterate over the users using map and show them in the Table.

ACT 8: 
Using the useEffect and useState hook set the users array into the state

ACT 9:
Using useContext send the users list and setter to the UserList Component so that we no longer need props.

ACT 10: 
Using React Router create dynamic routes for your users, passing the id as params in the URL, set the UserList component as home.

Create an onClick event so that when we click on a user we move to that user's detailed page.

ACT 11:
Using Fetch API and this URL: https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10 fill the page with this randomly generated users list, removing the need for the static users information.
